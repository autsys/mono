# Requirements

This relies on React, so use it with projects that already have React >=16.12

# Solves

Problems that have been run into more than once will be added to this library for future use.
Currently, this includes

- `useDebounce` - set a value after a delay.
- `usePrevious` - get a value after a render has occurred.
